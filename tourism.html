                                <p>The Hagia Sophia (Aya Sofya in Turkish) was the emperor's swaggering statement to the world of the wealth and technical ability of his empire.</p>
                                <p>Tradition maintained that the area surrounding the emperor's throne within the church was the official center of the world.</p>

                                <p>First built by Mehmet the Conqueror in the 15th century, this glorious palace beside the Bosphorus was where the sultans of the Ottoman Empire lived and ruled from.</p>
                                <p>To fully see Topkap覺 Palace, you'll need at least half a day.</p>

                                <p>Built between 1609 and 1616, the mosque caused a furore throughout the Muslim world when it was finished, as it had six minarets (the same number as the Great Mosque of Mecca).</p>
                                <p> A seventh minaret was eventually gifted to Mecca to stem the dissent.</p>
